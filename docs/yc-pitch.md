# DocSafe - YC Pitch

## One Line
Secure document sharing with complete user control - the "Plaid for PII documents".

## Problem
Every day, millions of people share sensitive documents (SSN, ID, medical records) with businesses through insecure channels:
- Email attachments
- Physical copies
- Unsecured uploads
- No control once shared
- No tracking of who has access
- High risk of identity theft

## Solution
DocSafe provides a secure, user-controlled way to share sensitive documents:
1. Business shows unique 5-minute passcode
2. User enters code in DocSafe
3. System verifies business legitimacy
4. User approves sharing
5. Complete tracking and revocation control

## Why Now?
1. Identity theft at all-time high ($56B in 2020)
2. Remote document sharing increased 300% post-COVID
3. New privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
4. Rising demand for secure digital verification
5. Businesses seeking compliance solutions
