# DocSafe MVP - Application Flow

## 1. User Registration & Verification Flow

### A. Initial Registration
1. User visits registration page
2. Enters basic information:
   - Full legal name
   - Date of birth
   - Email (for notifications only)
   - Password

### B. Identity Verification
1. User selects and provides ONE of the following:
   - Last 4 digits of SSN
   - Driver's License Number
   - State ID Number
   - Real ID Number

2. System checks with government database (simulated):
   - Validates provided ID with DOB
   - Cross-references name
   - Retrieves verified address from government database
   - Checks for existing accounts (anti-duplication)

3. If verification successful:
   - Account is created
   - User sets up recovery methods
   - Initial verified documents are pre-populated

4. If verification fails:
   - User is notified of the reason
   - Can retry with correct information
   - After 3 failures, 24-hour cooldown period

## 2. Account Recovery Process

### A. Multiple Recovery Methods
Users must set up at least two of the following recovery methods:

1. Recovery Phone Number
   - User provides verified phone number
   - System sends verification code via SMS
   - User confirms code to verify ownership
   - Used for future recovery via SMS codes

2. Backup Email Address
   - User provides alternate email
   - System sends verification link
   - User confirms email ownership
   - Used for future recovery via email links

3. Trusted Contact Recovery
   - User designates trusted family member or friend
   - System verifies trusted contact's identity
   - Contact must provide their own verified ID for recovery
   - Provides human support for less tech-savvy users

4. Government Office Recovery
   - Available to all users as fallback option
   - Requires in-person visit to any government office
   - Must present physical government ID
   - Highest security level for recovery

### B. Recovery Process Flow
1. User initiates recovery
2. Chooses preferred recovery method
3. System guides through method-specific steps:
   - Phone: SMS code verification
   - Email: Secure link verification
   - Trusted Contact: Contact verification process
   - Government Office: In-person verification
4. Upon successful verification:
   - User regains account access
   - Can update password if needed
   - Review and update recovery methods

### C. Recovery Method Management
1. Users can update recovery methods anytime
2. Must maintain minimum of two active methods
3. Regular prompts to verify recovery methods
4. Clear instructions for each method

## 3. Document Management

### A. Verified Documents
1. System automatically creates entries for:
   - Social Security Card
   - State ID/Driver's License
   - Birth Certificate (if verified)
2. Documents are marked as "Verified by Government"
3. Cannot be modified or deleted by user

### B. User-Uploaded Documents
1. User can upload additional documents:
   - Medicare/Medicaid Cards
   - Passport
   - Other government documents
2. Each upload requires:
   - Document type selection
   - Document image/PDF
   - Basic metadata (issue date, expiry)
3. System performs:
   - Virus scanning
   - Format validation
   - Encryption before storage

## 4. Document Sharing

### A. Business Verification
1. Business must register with:
   - Business registration number
   - Official email domain
   - Physical address
   - Industry classification
2. System verifies business legitimacy
3. Business gets unique identifier

### B. Sharing Process
1. Business requests document access:
   - Specifies required documents
   - States purpose
   - Sets time duration
2. User receives notification
3. User reviews request:
   - Can see business details
   - Purpose of request
   - Duration of access
4. User approves/denies request
5. If approved:
   - Temporary access token generated
   - Business can view document for specified duration
   - All access is logged

### C. Access Revocation
1. User can revoke access anytime
2. Automatic revocation:
   - When time period expires
   - If business account is suspended
   - If document is updated

## 5. Security Measures

### A. Document Security
1. All documents encrypted at rest
2. Unique encryption key per document
3. Access requires:
   - User authentication
   - Valid session
   - Access permissions

### B. Access Control
1. Document owner has full control
2. Businesses have temporary, read-only access
3. All actions are logged:
   - View attempts
   - Download attempts
   - Share activities
   - Access revocations

### C. Session Management
1. Limited session duration
2. One active session per user
3. Automatic logout on inactivity
4. IP tracking for suspicious activity

## 6. Government Database Simulation

### A. Data Structure
1. Citizen records containing:
   - SSN (hashed)
   - State ID/License numbers (hashed)
   - Name and DOB
   - Address history
   - Document history

### B. Verification APIs
1. Identity verification endpoint
2. Document validation endpoint
3. Address verification endpoint
4. Duplication check endpoint

## 7. Success Criteria

### A. Security
- Zero unauthorized access incidents
- 100% document encryption
- Complete access logging

### B. Performance
- Document access < 2 seconds
- Verification process < 5 seconds
- 99.9% uptime

### C. User Experience
- < 3 minute registration process
- < 30 second sharing process
- < 1% error rate in verification

## 8. MVP Limitations

### A. Technical Limitations
- Simulated government database
