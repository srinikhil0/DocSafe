# Secure Sharing Protocol

## Overview
The DocSafe Secure Sharing Protocol (DSSP) is designed to enable secure, traceable, and user-controlled sharing of sensitive documents. This protocol ensures that users maintain complete control over their PII (Personally Identifiable Information) while businesses can securely access required documents.

## Protocol Flow

### 1. Request Initiation
- Business generates a unique passcode through API
- Passcode is valid for 5 minutes only
- Each passcode is tied to:
  - Specific business ID
  - Document type requested
  - User session
  - Geographic location
  - Timestamp

### 2. User Authorization
- User inputs passcode in DocSafe app
- System validates:
  - Passcode authenticity
  - Time validity
  - Business legitimacy
  - Request appropriateness
- User receives business verification status
- User provides explicit consent

### 3. Document Transfer
- End-to-end encrypted transfer
- Document never stored on business servers
- Real-time validation signatures
- Chunked transfer for large documents
- Automatic access expiration

### 4. Audit Trail
- Complete activity logging
- Access timestamps
- Geographic location tracking
- Device fingerprinting
- User consent records

## Security Measures

### Passcode Security
- 12-character alphanumeric
- One-time use only
- Business-specific prefix
- Anti-brute force protection
- Rate limiting per business

### Business Verification
- Domain validation
- Business license check
- Compliance status verification
- Historical trust score
- Real-time risk assessment

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Hardware security modules
- Encrypted key exchange

## Integration Guidelines

### API Endpoints
```javascript
POST /api/v1/passcode/generate
GET  /api/v1/passcode/validate
POST /api/v1/document/share
POST /api/v1/access/revoke
GET  /api/v1/audit/log
```

### Web Component
```html
<doc-safe-request
  business-id="YOUR_ID"
  document-type="SSN"
  callback="onDocumentReceived"
  style="theme: modern"
>
</doc-safe-request>
```
