# Security Architecture

## Overview
DocSafe's security architecture is built on the principle of zero-trust and complete user control. Every component is designed with security-first thinking and multiple layers of protection.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero Knowledge Architecture
- Server never sees unencrypted documents
- Client-side encryption
- No plain-text storage
- Encrypted search capabilities
- Secure key management

### 2. Multi-Layer Authentication
- User authentication
- Device authentication
- Business verification
- Action-based authentication
- Behavioral analysis

### 3. Access Control
- Granular permissions
- Time-based access
- Location-based restrictions
- Purpose-based sharing
- Dynamic revocation

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Encryption System
```
Document → Client-side Encryption → Encrypted Storage
↓
AES-256 Encryption
↓
Key Generation (per document)
↓
Master Key Encryption
↓
Hardware Security Module
```

### 2. Authentication Flow
```
User Login → 2FA → Device Verification
↓
Session Token Generation
↓
Continuous Authentication
↓
Activity Monitoring
```

### 3. Document Security
- Individual encryption per document
- Unique access keys
- Version control
- Secure deletion
- Audit logging

## Infrastructure Security

### 1. Network Security
- DDoS protection
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Network segmentation
- Regular penetration testing
- Real-time monitoring

### 2. Data Centers
- Geographic distribution
- Redundant systems
- Physical security
- Environmental controls
- Disaster recovery

### 3. Monitoring Systems
- 24/7 security monitoring
- Intrusion detection
- Anomaly detection
- Access logging
- Performance monitoring

## Compliance Framework

### 1. Standards Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- HIPAA
- GDPR
- PCI DSS

### 2. Security Policies
- Access control policy
- Data retention policy
- Incident response plan
- Business continuity plan
- Employee security training

### 3. Regular Assessments
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews
- Architecture reviews
- Third-party audits

## Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated alerts
- User reporting
- System checks
- External monitoring

### 2. Response Protocol
1. Incident Detection
2. Initial Assessment
3. Containment
4. Investigation
5. Remediation
6. Recovery
7. Documentation
8. Post-mortem

### 3. Communication Plan
- Internal notification
- User notification
- Business notification
- Regulatory reporting
- Public disclosure (if required)

## Security Features

### 1. Document Level
- Individual encryption
- Access controls
- Watermarking
- Version control
- Audit trails

### 2. User Level
