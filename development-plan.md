## Development Guidelines

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning (2-3 hours)**
   - Review previous day's work
   - Fix any blocking issues
   - Core development tasks

2. **Afternoon (3-4 hours)**
   - Main feature development
   - Testing and debugging
   - Documentation updates

3. **Evening (1-2 hours)**
   - Code review and cleanup
   - Plan next day's tasks
   - Backup and git commits

### Development Practices
- Commit code at least 3 times daily
- Test features as they're built
- Maintain a daily task list
- Keep documentation updated
- Regular backups of database

### Testing Strategy
- Test core features immediately after development
- End-of-day integration testing
- Weekend comprehensive testing
- Security testing for each feature

### Priority Guidelines
1. **Must Have (MVP)**
   - User authentication
   - Document upload/storage
   - Basic document viewer
   - Essential security features
   - Document sharing with OTP

2. **Should Have**
   - Search functionality
   - Basic categorization
   - Share history
   - Basic dashboard

3. **Nice to Have**
   - Advanced search
   - Custom categories
   - Detailed analytics
   - Advanced viewer features

### Contingency Time Allocation
- 20% buffer time for each week
- Weekends for overflow tasks
- Priority features first
- Flexible feature scope

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Database backup every evening
- Regular code commits
- Local development backup
- Document all configuration

### Time Management
- Focus on one feature at a time
- No premature optimization
- Minimize meetings/distractions
- Use time tracking

### Quality Assurance
- Test-as-you-go approach
- End-of-day testing routine
- Security-first development
- Regular performance checks
